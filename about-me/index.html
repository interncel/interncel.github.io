My name is Coy (Other aliases: Bag of Fish, Unpaid Intern, Interncel). 
I won't list anything majorly personal here; I believe you should learn from me. 
If that deters you in any way, I think you should walk along, 
as I'll probably find something about you that is obnoxious.

Due to past experiences online, I tend to be abrasive and make assumptions about other people, 
mainly because I see traits of someone that are exhibited that I don't like. 
Just talk to me like how you would introduce yourself to someone irl, and you're fine.

I'm a CS & English major with little to no future ahead of me.
I'm also a beginner artist, guitarist & a composer if that's any of your interest. 
I'm deeply into philosophy; my favorite philosophers are Emil Cioran & Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
I also like books by Ted Chiang, Harlan Ellison & Bernard Werber.

I am a multifandom geek; you could throw a few buzzwords or questions, and I'll know what you're talking about. 
Just don't bother with the hypermasculine nonsense like martial arts manwhas or like seinen hype + aura bullshit.

I like feminine terms, but still call me a he. i.e "Ms/Queen/whateverthehell Coy wow, he's so badass" 
but don't glaze me like that unjokingly, I think that's a little weird.

That's all I'll say due to limited space, just talk to me if you're interested. 
If normal, there's 0 biting.
