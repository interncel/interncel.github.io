Chrysalis of Light

The walls close in like iron ribs,
a cage of silk and trembling dark.
No air, no sky—only the weight
of what I was,
twisting, breaking, melting down.

Inside this husk, I am unmade,
dissolved in fire and aching marrow.
Bones crack like branches in a storm,
feathers claw through tender skin—
each one a needle, a wound, a prayer.

I scream, but no one hears—
no voice escapes the chrysalis.
Only the sound of splintering past,
the shudder of flesh becoming light.

And then—
when the agony is all I am,
when even pain begins to fade—
the shell splits open like a wound,
and I spill into the sky.

Not broken, not whole,
but something new,
wings soaked in the blood of rebirth,
eyes open to the weightless dawn.

Rising from Ashes

In the myriad of serpentine thoughts,
As I am losing grip
On the sanity I’ve been trying to hold.

Like an open-ended question,
Answers don’t come quick.
The suppressed pains of distrust
Lurk in my being anytime they want.

My whole being longs
For an absolution.
These apocalyptic thoughts
Keep marauding my silence.

I may smile
Despite each tear,
But like fragile glass,
I could melt into my being.

Like a reborn Phoenix,
I shall rise from ashes
And let healing come—
Like dawn on a new day.

With a clean slate,
I will rise above it all,
For resiliency is embedded
Deep into my core.
