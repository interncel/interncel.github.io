Chrysalis of Light

The walls close in like iron ribs,
a cage of silk and trembling dark.
No air, no sky—only the weight
of what I was,
twisting, breaking, melting down.

Inside this husk, I am unmade,
dissolved in fire and aching marrow.
Bones crack like branches in a storm,
feathers claw through tender skin—
each one a needle, a wound, a prayer.

I scream, but no one hears—
no voice escapes the chrysalis.
Only the sound of splintering past,
the shudder of flesh becoming light.

And then—
when the agony is all I am,
when even pain begins to fade—
the shell splits open like a wound,
and I spill into the sky.

Not broken, not whole,
but something new,
wings soaked in the blood of rebirth,
eyes open to the weightless dawn.

Rising from Ashes

In the myriad of serpentine thoughts,
As I am losing grip
On the sanity I’ve been trying to hold.

Like an open-ended question,
Answers don’t come quick.
The suppressed pains of distrust
Lurk in my being anytime they want.

My whole being longs
For an absolution.
These apocalyptic thoughts
Keep marauding my silence.

I may smile
Despite each tear,
But like fragile glass,
I could melt into my being.

Like a reborn Phoenix,
I shall rise from ashes
And let healing come—
Like dawn on a new day.

With a clean slate,
I will rise above it all,
For resiliency is embedded
Deep into my core.

If I Forget

If I forget your name one day,
Please know I’d never turn away.
My mind may drift, my thoughts may slow,
But in my heart, I still will know.

If stories fade or come out wrong,
And silence takes the place of song,
Just sit with me, don’t rush to speak—
Your presence gives me all I seek.

There may be times I seem unsure,
A knock without a name or door.
But something in your touch, your tone—
It tells me I’m not quite alone.

You might repeat the same reply,
Watch questions circle, pass you by.
Still answer kind—still take my hand—
I’m doing all I understand.

And if I lose the words to say
"I love you" in the usual way,
Please hear it in a quiet sigh,
A glance, a tear, a heavy eye.

Though memory may come and go,
The soul remembers what it knows.
So stay with me, and you will see:
The heart holds on, even if I can't be.

The Edge of Meaning
𝒶𝒻𝓉𝑒𝓇 𝒲𝒾𝓉𝓉𝑔𝑒𝓃𝓈𝓉𝑒𝒾𝓃

The world is all that is the case—
each moment held in time and place.
Not hidden realms or inner grace,
but just the facts we learn to face.

We speak in signs, we build with care
a model of the world out there.
But some things—love, or what is true—
no sentence ever quite gets through.

Where words fall short, we start to feel
that silence frames what’s most real.
And so, beyond the things we say,
we live, we look, and walk away.
